R Visualization: Relocation Guidebook for Data Scientists and More

If you are a data scientist and you are offered a job in another city - or if your current employer asks you to relocate - would you make the move? Many may happily accept the offer and begin a new chapter of their life. Others may struggle to write down a comprehensive cost benefit analysis to avoid making a mistake. It is possible to use data visualization to quickly compare and contrast living standards and make an informed choice in a few simple steps.
